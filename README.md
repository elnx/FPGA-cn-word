Some Verilog HDL code to show 4 Chinese words on the 16x16 LED on FPGA board for my EE lab.
##Details
- `tanxiaofengsheng.v` store the 16x16 coded data.
- `scroll.v` control the 4 words to scroll from up to down.
- `display.v` scan the LEDs to show the words.
- `wallace_top.v` is the top-level module.
